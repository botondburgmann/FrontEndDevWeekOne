    <p>My favorite and most important hobby is probably working out, especially weight training. I have been doing
        strength training in one way shape or form for almost 10 years now. My favorite method is lifting weights in a
        gym, but lately I'm also doing home workouts and I love calisthenics, although I am not that good at that yet.

        I like fitness, because it has a number of positive effects on both my mental and physical health. Besides,
        obviously helping me look better and stronger, it also makes me mentally stronger, feeling great, and just
        healthier in general.
