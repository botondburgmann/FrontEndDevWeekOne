        As a rather "lazier, unhealthier" hobby I also like playing video games. I have lots of games for PC and for
        PS4. I, of course, started playing them from a very young age, and even till this day, I enjoy firing up my
        console and play for a few hours. Even though, I haven't really been playing much lately, since I try to be more
        productive and I have bigger priorities.

        On the topic of what's my favorite type of game, I prefer single player, story based games, to multiplayer
        games, like League of Legends or CS:GO. Thanks, I already hate myself, I don't need those too.
        My favorite games include the GTA, Uncharted and Assassin's Creed series, as well as The Last of Us I and II.
