        A hobby that I picked up relatively recently, is photography. I am not that good in it, but I would like to
        become better. I especially like travel photos, landscapes, urban and street photography. But my favorite style
        is probably night photography, and I just love the cyberpunk aesthetics.

        However, in contrast to my other hobbies, with photography, I haven't been that consistent, and for a year, I
        haven't done it at all. But it is still something I would like to do more in the future.
