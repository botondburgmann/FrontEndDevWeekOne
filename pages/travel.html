        I love travelling and visiting new places. So far, I have been to 19 countries (18 if we don't count Hungary).
        However, I have only been to European countries so far, and I definitely plan to travel to other continents too.
        In fact, I wanna visit every country I can. Of course, while staying alive, so not every country in the world, I
        can skip North Korea for example. But I wanna visit as many places as possible.
    </p>
    <p>I also like travelling alone. I travelled to Cyprus and Belgium by myself and I absolutely loved it. They're
        probably my favorite travel experiences and I definitely want to go back to those places.

        But my all time favorite travel experience was Poland. Although it wasn't so much travelling, since I lived
        there for 5 months. I completed an Erasmus semester in Wrocław, but also visited Poznań, Katowice and Kraków. I
        went to concerts of some of my favorite Polish artists, made new friends and partied with them a lot, and
        overall had a great experience. Even though, the university constantly tried to sabotage my well-being, I still
        managed to bring the most out of my stay.
